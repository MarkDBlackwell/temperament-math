** Introduction

Temperament-Math: calculate variegated circulating tuning temperaments

Copyright (C) 2021 Mark D. Blackwell.

** Usage

`ruby lib/TemperamentMath/calculate.rb`

Then enter the tuning values into your tuner.
For example, I use Stichting Huygens-Fokker's program, Scala to tune my harpsichord.

To generate more temperaments,
you might adjust variables `fifth_max` and `fifth_min` in the program.

The program is known to work with Ruby version 2.7.0p0.

** Explanation

All of the tuning temperaments generated by the program
have one property: the major thirds are all variegated.
In particular,
if you consider that each forms part of the tonic chord of a major key,
then each major third's tuning width increases
with the number of sharps or flats in the key signature.
This resembles Thomas Young's first temperament.
However, unlike with Young's, each sharp key's major third is closer to just
than the corresponding flat key, so the variety is increased.
The sharp keys are favored over the flat keys,
in order to improve the sound of the
major dominant chords of commonly-used minor keys,
such as E-major for A-minor, A-major for D-minor,
and even B-major for E-minor, etc.
Another difference from Young is that the CE major third is perfectly just.

x-sub-i is a numbered perfect fifth in the circle of fifths, rising to G, D, etc.:

x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 x7 x8 x9 x10 x11 x12
G  D  A  E  B  F# C# G# D# A#  F   C

In this program, they are called @@fifth_1, etc.

n-sub-i is a numbered major third in the circle of fifths, again rising to G, D, etc.:

1    2    3    4    5    6    6    5    4     3    2     1
n4 < n5 < n3 < n6 < n2 < n7 < n1 < n8 < n12 < n9 < n11 < n10
E    B    A    F#   D    C#   G    G#   C     D#   F     A#

In this program, they are called @@third_1, etc.

The first line of numbers is the level number.
